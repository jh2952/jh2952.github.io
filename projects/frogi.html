        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          During this game jam, I wanted to implement several simple game
          mechanics while exploring making my own music and art assets; all
          while using godot for my first real project. <br /><br />
          I implemented four main mechanics:
        <br><br>
          1. I created a dynamic parallax background effect when the player clicks to start the game.
          <br><br>
          2. I created a slow targeting system inspired by dome keeper.
          <br><br>
          3. I created a mechanic where the player uses their tongue to catch creatures.
          <br><br>
          4. I created a damage system where creatures colliding with the player damage them if they're not careful.
          <br><br>
          In my opinion (based on my reading of <a href="">Rules of Play</a> and <a href="">The Art of Game Design</a> ) game mechanics evoke meaningful play insofar as they are discernable (the player can perceive the immediate outcome of their action) and integrated (the outcome of an action is woven into the game system as a whole.)
          <br><br>
          My intention with the game was to create a zen-like experience, where players enter a flow state. I believe I did this by slowing the controls down to a snails pace, creating relaxing ambient music, and make the creatures move slowly. 
          <br><br>
          Based on the feedback from players in the jam, I believe I met this goal of meaningful play. The design of the game was such that players could easily understand it and begin playing. However, several players stated that the controls were in-fact <i>unbearably</i> slow. In the future, I would playtest different speeds to see what is best for evoking the feeling I intend for while also minimizing unintended frustration.

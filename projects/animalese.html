      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        During this game jam, I wanted to implement an animalese mechanic in
        our dialogue system to have stylised voice clips for each character
        such as in games like Animal Crossing or Celeste.
        <br /><br />
        I am happy with the outcome of my design. It's easily extendable, as I
        created a DialogueVoice ScriptableObject asset in Unity, in which
        audio clips can be associated to characters and then dropped into
        dialogue boxes; making it easy to integrate new voices.
        <br /><br />
        I also learned a lot about audio popping, as initially my samples were
        too long and were being cut off by the next audio clip playing. To fix
        this, I tightened up the samples by fading in and out quicker and
        zeroing out the beginning and end of them. Additionally, I re-recorded
        certain samples to avoid heavy breathy sounds (e.g., beginning of an H
        sound and the end of many vowels.)
        <br /><br />
        This tool was made by me and used by my team, and I got great feedback
        from them in terms of usability and quality.

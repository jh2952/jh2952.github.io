      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Prior to starting my career as a games programmer, I graduated with a
        degree in Physics from the University of Bath. Over the past eighteen
        months, I've been doing a level 7 games programming apprenticeship with
        Sumo Digital via the Sumo Academy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Here, I've gained incredible experience working on several real-world commercial projects. I've worked closely with experienced industry veterans from a wide range of disciplines including artists, designers, producers and directors. I've worked with publishers and stakeholders to develop games with a shared vision. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>I've developed an interest particularly in the <i>sensory</i> programming disciplines: Audio, Graphics, Gameplay and Physics. I've worked with graphics API's, written many shaders, implemented a multitude of game mechanics and systems, and I've worked with physics API's to implement unique physical behaviour.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Please take a look at my <a href="index.html">projects</a> to get a better understanding of the skills I've developed!</p>
